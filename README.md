## Features

- **Thirteen engines** (below), each with its own factory presets; every factory sound has a category (BASS, LEAD,
  PAD, PLUCK, KEYS, DRUM, FX, OTHER) to browse by
- **Four tracks**, one synth part each with its own engine and sound (drums are the DRUM engine);
  8 voices shared between them. ALGORITHM selects the track on every page
- **Sequencer:** 64 steps per track with chords, ties, accent, slide, per-step chance and ratchets
  (a step played 2, 3 or 4 times in its length); a piano roll of the steps; a drum grid (white keys =
  steps, black keys = lanes); automation: recording of knob moves per step (an automation icon marks the cards it
  drives); live loop recording with overdub; step recording at the cursor (REC on SEQ > STEP while stopped), one
  chord at a time or note by note (MENU > CHORD ENTRY ADD); divisions listed by length, 4 bars to 1/32; loading a
  sound never touches your patterns
- **Timing:** live recording keeps when you played each note, as a per-step **NUDGE** (1/16 of a step, half a step
  early to 7/16 late); the track's **QUANTIZE** decides what plays: ON (the default) every step on the grid, as
  always, OFF your own timing. Nudges can also be set by hand
- **Parameter locks and the AUTOMATION list:** hold a step on SEQ > STEP (or the drum grid) and turn a knob to set
  that parameter for that step only; EDIT with the step held clears its locks. **SEQ > AUTOMATION** is one list of
  everything that happens on the track's steps: PLAY / CLEAR, QUANTIZE, each step's CHANCE, RATCH and NUDGE, its
  locks and automation events; change their step, parameter or value, turn a lock into automation or back, add or
  delete one. 128 records shared by the four tracks. SAVE held undoes every edit
- **SEQ TOOLS:** hold SEQ on any page for tools on the keys: CLEAR, REVERSE, SHIFT < / >, **RANDOM** (a new beat,
  or new notes in the scale on the same rhythm) and **COOK** (changes the pattern a little each press); on a DRUM
  track also BEAT and each lane's CLEAR, REVERSE, FILL and RANDOM; KNOB 1–4 are LEN, DIV, SWING and GATE. Each tool
  is one undo (SAVE held); OCT− puts the track back as the layer found it
- **Metronome and count-in:** CLICK (OFF, while recording, or always) with three levels, and a count-in
  of 1 or 2 bars before recording from stop; the click goes to the headphones and speaker only, never to
  USB audio or into a pattern
- **Songs** (GLO > SONG): up to 16 sections, each naming the project slot (A–D) **every track** plays, or "-" for a
  track that rests there, with its repeats; drawn as a timeline with a lane per track
- **Chord keys:** one finger plays an in-key chord (triads or sevenths of the scale, or fixed chord
  shapes), with voicings; on the keys, MIDI in, recording and the arpeggiator
- **Arpeggiator** with UP, DN, UPDN, RND, ORD (the notes in the order you pressed them), REPEAT and, for chords,
  DNUP, UP+8, CONV, DIVG, PINKY, THUMB, WALK and CHORD; a beat LED; 16 scales with a white-key mode, glide,
  MONO / LEGATO / UNISON
- **LFO:** RATE or **SYNC** to a note value (4 bars to 1/32, following the tempo or an external clock), **TRIG** NOTE
  or FREE, **POL** bipolar or unipolar (LFO > LFO 2)
- **Modulation matrix:** 4 slots per track, MIDI controllers as sources, **S&H** and **SLEW** (a random value per
  LFO cycle, held or gliding), and **DEPTH** as a destination, so the matrix can modulate the LFO itself
- **SPREAD** (EDIT > VOICE 3): the voices of a POLY or UNISON track alternate left and right of its PAN
- **Effects:** distortion and the SLICER per track; chorus, delay and reverb sends (the reverb as
  **HALL**, ROOM or SPRING; HALL is a smooth stereo reverb, the default on a fresh start); master limiter
- **FX layer:** hold FX for repeat, reverse, filter sweeps, tape stop, freeze, a harmonizer
  (OCT UP / OCT DN with shimmer), **FLANGER** and **PHASER** (in time with the tempo), and mutes on the black keys;
  any white key can hold any effect (hold the key in the layer and turn PRESETS); MENU > FX LATCH makes them toggle,
  so nothing has to stay held
- **MOMENTARY:** hold LFO and turn a knob on HOME or a sound / FX page; let go of LFO and the value jumps back
  (OCT+ while holding keeps it)
- **Quick layers:** hold FX, GLO, SCL, EDIT, REC or SEQ for shortcuts on the keys and knobs, or double-tap it to
  keep the layer open; one-step undo (SAVE held); REC on every page; OCT+ confirms, OCT- goes back; what can be
  pressed breathes softly instead of blinking
- **Presets:** factory presets, 32 user preset slots and 4 projects, named on the device (an FM6
  sound keeps its own patch in both); user presets get a category, and a project can get a random name; projects
  from every earlier version load. The PRESETS knob changes the sound from every page that is not a list.
  Turn the FM-1 off and on and the music is as you left it (MENU > RESTORE LAST, an autosave of its own,
  written only when stopped and idle)
- **Screen:** flat UI with Inter Tight and Fukiai icons, FLAT or LINE style, 10 palettes including
  grayscale, black and white, high contrast and NIGHT; type in sizes by role (what you read in the larger size,
  labels and hints in the smaller); MENU > LARGE for tall knob cards with larger labels and values; the menu in
  five tabs. The header shows the track and the **project slot of its pattern** ("1 A", "1 A*" once edited), the
  play state and the tempo. HOME shows the oscilloscope or, with MENU > HOME TRACKS, **the four tracks** with their
  steps playing; the screen can go dark when the panel is left alone (MENU > SCREEN OFF)
- **LEDs:** idle buttons and keys glow dim so the panel can be found in the dark (MENU > LEDS: OFF,
  DIM LO, DIM HI or INV, the official firmware's look); PLAY turns green while playing; the keys show
  the notes the sequencer and MIDI IN play, and on SEQ > STEP (stopped) the notes of the step under the cursor;
  the drum grid marks the beats (steps 1, 5, 9, 13); MENU > SCALE LEDS shows the track's scale on the keys;
  a soft light sweeps over the keys at power-on, and with MENU > ANIM IDLE drifts over them while the FM-1 waits
- **USB:** class-compliant MIDI in and out, and a stereo audio input ("Felucca") at 44.1 or 48 kHz
  (the computer picks) that records the master output on the computer, no driver needed (at a fixed level with MENU > USB LEVEL FIXED;
  on macOS 13–15, set MENU > USB SERIAL to OFF so the audio input appears)
- **MIDI:** USB and TRS MIDI in; MENU > MIDI > MIDI IN: CH1-4 (channels 1–4 play tracks 1–4), CH5-8, CH9-12 or
  CH13-16 (another block of four, e.g. for two FM-1s on one cable), or SEL (every channel plays the selected track);
  the keys send on the track's channel; pitch bend, sustain, panic; clock from internal, USB or TRS. MIDI CCs set
  track parameters: 5 GLIDE, 7 LEVEL, 10 PAN, 71 resonance, 72 / 73 / 75 release / attack / decay, 74 brightness,
  91 / 93 / 94 the reverb, chorus and delay sends
- **Web:** editor for every parameter (with a 6-operator FM patch editor), step grid, mixer,
  preset library, sample upload and recording with trim, the MENU settings; full backup and restore;
  return to the official firmware; Felucca itself running in the browser

## ⚠ Coming from 1.1.5

1.4 is the first release since 1.1.5.1 and holds a lot. Everything you saved loads and sounds as before, except
where marked here:

- **Projects are saved in a new format (FUN10).** 1.4 opens every older project, but **1.1.5.x and older cannot
  open a project saved by 1.4**: they show its slot as empty (the data stays in flash until you save something into
  that slot there), and refuse a backup that holds one. User presets saved by 1.4 load on 1.1.5.x without the five
  new values (LFO 2's SYNC, TRIG and POL, QUANTIZE, SPREAD).
- **ARP ORD now plays the held notes in the order you pressed them** (up to 1.1.5 it played them as UP): a sound
  or project using ORD sounds different when its notes were pressed in another order than low to high.
- **SAMPLE's PIANO is a lighter lo-fi piano** (two notes at 11,025 Hz, 1.6 s each; up to 1.1.5 five notes at
  22,050 Hz, 0.75 s), and so are the sounds that use it (GRAIN's FROZEN and SHIMMER too). For the old piano, install
  **PIANO HD** into a user slot from the web editor and set those sounds' SET (GRAIN: SRC) to that slot. SLICE's
  PIANO is unchanged.
- **The pages moved** (Discussion #153): see Controls below. In short: SEQ is STEP and AUTOMATION; **SEQ held is SEQ
  TOOLS on every page** (it no longer opens SONG); **GLO opens SONG**; PHRASES is on SAVE; HOME goes round HOME,
  MIXER and CLOCK (BPM, swing, clock source); TUNE is MENU > AUDIO, MIDI IN (ROUT) is MENU > MIDI, and the USB state
  and CPU load are MENU > SYSTEM > INFO. REC held is the REC layer as before.
- **SONG has a lane per track**: older songs load with all four tracks on each row's slot and play as before; its
  knobs are KNOB 1 SECTION, 2 TRACK, 3 PAT, 4 REPS, and on SONG the white keys A3 B3 C4 D4 set the slot.
- **A fresh start uses the HALL reverb** (up to 1.1.5: ROOM). Saved projects keep their reverb TYPE.
- **BASS+ (MENU > SPEAKER EQ) is softer:** its added harmonics are at half the level, so a full-scale kick no longer
  distorts (#180).
- **The web editor** needs its 1.4 update for the new features; use the one on the site.

## Controls

![FM-1 controls with Felucca](docs/controls.jpg)

- Tap a page button for its page, again for the next; HOME returns home. Page buttons act when let go
- Hold FX, GLO, SCL, EDIT, REC or SEQ for its quick layer; hold SAVE to undo, HOME for the menu; hold LFO and turn a
  knob for a MOMENTARY change
- Double-tap a layer's button to keep its layer open without holding; tap it again to close
- On SEQ > STEP, hold a step and turn KNOB 1–4 to lock those parameters on that step (PRESETS: its NUDGE)
- On action pages and in dialogs, OCT+ does it and OCT− goes back; in the menu, OCT+ / OCT− change the value and HOME closes it
- Save a sound: stop, tap SAVE, pick a slot with KNOB 1, then OCT+ and OCT+ again (name it with the keys)

The pages by button:

| Button | Taps go round | Held |
|---|---|---|
| HOME | HOME, MIXER, CLOCK (BPM, swing, clock source) | the menu |
| SEQ | STEP (the piano roll, or the drum grid), AUTOMATION | SEQ TOOLS, on every page |
| GLO | SONG | the GLO layer (mutes, solos, levels, TAP tempo) |
| SAVE | USER, PHRASES (the pattern loader), PROJECT, TOOLS, PRESETS | UNDO |
| LFO | LFO, LFO 2, LFO DEST, MOD | MOMENTARY (with a knob) |
| EDIT | EDIT 1, EDIT 2, VOICE, VOICE 2, VOICE 3 (FM6 adds OPERATOR, OP ENV, OPERATOR 2; DRUM LANES; SLICE SLICES) | the EDIT layer (the engines) |
| FX, SCL, ENV, ARP | their pages, as before | FX and SCL: their layers |
| REC | arms the track | the REC layer (CLEAR, CLICK, COUNT-IN, CLICK LEVEL) |

## Menu

Hold **HOME** for the menu, in five tabs: **DISPLAY** (COLOR, STYLE, LARGE, ANIM, LEDS, SCREEN OFF, SCOPE, HOME),
**CONTROL** (HOLD, KNOB ACCEL, FX LATCH, BPM LOCK, SCALE LEDS, STEP PREVIEW, CHORD ENTRY), **AUDIO** (SPEAKER EQ,
USB LEVEL, CLICK, CLICK LEVEL, COUNT-IN, TUNE), **MIDI** (MIDI IN) and **SYSTEM** (USB SERIAL, RESTORE LAST,
HARDWARE CALIBRATION, INFO, ABOUT).
ALGORITHM moves between the tabs and PRESETS through the rows of one; any of KNOB 1–4, or OCT+ / OCT−,
changes the value (OCT+ opens HARDWARE CALIBRATION, INFO and ABOUT); press HOME to close the menu. Every new
setting defaults to the earlier behaviour. The web editor's Settings tab reads and changes them too, saved the same
way as from the menu, in the same tabs.

- **COLOR:** the palette. GREY (grayscale, called MONO up to 1.0.1), GREEN, AMBER, ICE, VIOLET, ROSE,
  PAPER (light), HI-CON (high contrast), NIGHT (the 0.9 look: true black, green-tinted text) and MONO
  (black and white)
- **STYLE:** FLAT (filled cards) or LINE (areas divided by thin lines)
- **LARGE:** OFF or ON: on HOME and the value pages the four knob cards grow tall, marked K1–K4, with
  larger labels and values about twice the size; the graph below becomes a strip. Lists, the piano roll,
  the drum grid and the quick layers keep their layout with larger labels
- **ANIM:** ON, OFF or IDLE. OFF shows every change at once, without rolling digits, a gliding piano roll or
  the LED sweep at power-on. IDLE is ON plus a gentle LED animation after a minute without input: a soft light drifts
  over the keys and the buttons breathe; any key, button or knob ends it and does what it always does. It never runs
  while playing, with a track armed, in a layer, the menu or a dialog
- **LEDS:** OFF (no glow), DIM LO, DIM HI (default) or INV (the idle LEDs lit, the active ones dark).
  What can be pressed breathes up to about 60 % of a lit LED, about 30 % with DIM LO
- **SCREEN OFF:** NEVER (default), 5 MIN, 15 MIN, 30 MIN or 60 MIN: after that long with no button, key or knob
  touched, the screen goes dark; the sound, the sequencer, MIDI and USB go on. The backlight stays on (on the FM-1
  its line also enables the buttons and keys). The next button, key or knob only turns the screen back on
- **SCOPE:** OUT (default) or MIX: what HOME's oscilloscope shows. OUT the sound after MASTER (the picture shrinks
  with the volume), MIX the mix before MASTER, the same size at any volume
- **HOME:** SCOPE (default) or TRACKS: under HOME's four cards, the oscilloscope or the four tracks, a row each with
  its sound, its steps playing, MUTE and a meter. Only the look changes: the knobs work as on SCOPE
- **HOLD:** how long a layer's button is held before its map shows
- **KNOB ACCEL:** OFF (one step per click) or ON: a fast, steady turn of a wide value moves 2 to 4 steps
  per click, up to 8 on values of more than 64 steps, the FX and GLO layers' knobs included; lists never
  jump. ON or OFF, every click of a fast turn counts
- **FX LATCH:** ON, FX + an effect key turns the effect on until pressed again, the knob macros stay
  where you leave them, and FX + OCT− turns everything off
- **BPM LOCK:** ON, SELECT no longer changes the tempo; hold GLO and turn SELECT, tap F4 in the GLO
  layer or use HOME > CLOCK instead
- **SCALE LEDS:** OFF or ON: the keys show the selected track's scale all the time (the root a little
  brighter); not on DRUM or SLICE tracks
- **STEP PREVIEW:** OFF (default) or ON: on SEQ > STEP with the transport stopped, moving the cursor plays the step
  it lands on once (its notes or hits, through the track's sound)
- **CHORD ENTRY:** HOLD (default) or ADD: how step recording writes. HOLD: the keys held together become the step,
  letting go moves on. ADD: each key adds its note to the step, up to 4 (a key whose note is there takes it out),
  and KNOB 1 moves on, so a chord goes in one finger at a time
- **SPEAKER EQ:** FLAT, LOWCUT or BASS+, a tone setting for the built-in speaker (not a switch). It also
  shapes the headphone out and USB audio, so keep it on FLAT when recording. The firmware cannot turn
  the speaker off, but headphones in the jack do
- **USB LEVEL:** MASTER (the MASTER knob sets the USB audio level too) or FIXED (USB always at full
  level, MASTER sets only the speaker and headphones)
- **CLICK:** OFF (default), REC (while a track is armed) or ON: a click on every beat while playing, the
  bar's first beat higher. **CLICK LEVEL:** LOW, MID (default) or HIGH; MASTER sets it too
- **COUNT-IN:** OFF (default), 1 BAR or 2 BARS: with a track armed, PLAY counts in first (clicking even with
  CLICK OFF), and a note played in the last half beat lands on step 1. Not with an external clock
- **TUNE:** the global tuning, −50 to +50 cents. It is the project's, saved and loaded with it
- **MIDI IN:** CH1-4 (default), SEL, CH5-8, CH9-12 or CH13-16 (see MIDI above). The project's too
- **USB SERIAL:** ON or OFF, applied when the menu closes (the FM-1 reconnects). OFF leaves out the
  serial console, a developer tool, so the FM-1 is a plain audio + MIDI device; this lets macOS 13–15
  see its USB audio input. MIDI, the editor and the installer work either way
- **RESTORE LAST:** ON (default) or OFF. ON, the FM-1 starts with the music you left (the header says
  RESTORED), kept in an autosave apart from the four projects; it is written when the music changed, the
  transport is stopped and nothing has been touched for 10 s, at most once a minute. OFF starts with the
  power-on sounds
- **HARDWARE CALIBRATION**, **INFO** (the version, the USB link and the CPU load) and **ABOUT**

## Engines

In the order the device lists them:

- **ANALOG**: virtual analog; two oscillators (WAVE SYNC: the second hard-synced to the first; SUB: a square an
  octave down), noise, drive, resonant low-pass filter
- **FM6**: classic 6-operator FM (Dexed-based): 32 algorithms, a full patch per track, edited in the
  web editor (which imports .syx files) or on the device: EDIT > OPERATOR (ratio or fixed frequency, fine, level),
  OP ENV (each stage's rate and level, drawn as the envelope) and OPERATOR 2 (mode, detune, velocity), one
  operator at a time on the algorithm chart; macros on top; SLOT picks a factory patch (F1–F8) or the track's own (OWN)
- **PHASE**: phase distortion (ported from CrispyZebra)
- **LOFI**: chiptune; pulse, triangle, saw, noise and a 4-bit wave RAM, stepped envelope, sweep, arpeggio
- **SAMPLE**: multisampled instruments (PIANO, a light lo-fi piano; FLUTE; SAX) and 3 user sample slots. PIANO HD,
  the fuller piano of 1.0 to 1.1.5, installs into a user slot from the web editor
- **VOICE**: formant oscillator, sung vowels
- **TRIO**: 3 oscillators with ring modulation and sync, multimode filter
- **WHEEL**: tonewheel-style organ; drawbar registrations, percussion, key click, drive, rotary speaker
- **GRAIN**: granular textures from the built-in samples or a user slot
- **PHYS**: physical models: modal resonators, strings, struck membranes, sympathetic strings
- **NOISE**: noise from analog to digital: colours, crackle, shift-register and metallic tones
- **SLICE**: a drum break, a piano note (both built in) or your own sample cut into slices, one per key;
  set the slices by hand on the SLICES page
- **DRUM**: an 8-lane kit of Felucca's own drum voices on the General MIDI key map. KIT picks the
  standard kit or one of five virtual-analog (VA) kits in the manner of
  classic analog drum machines (the numbers are a hint), every lane its own voice: **80** (deep sine kick with a long decay, noisy snare,
  six-square hats), **10** (swept kick, white-noise snare, long-tailed claps, a cymbal), **66** (soft
  round kick, bright snare, noise hats, a conga), **55** (dropping kick, high metal hats, a metal bell)
  and **77** (swelling kick, multi-burst claps, claves, a cymbal). All of them are synthesized by
  Felucca, no samples. EDIT > LANES and LANES 2 set each lane's level

The DIGITAL engine of 0.9 has been replaced by FM6: projects and presets with DIGITAL sounds load
as FM6 sounds converted from them. The SAMPLE engine's PERC kit was removed in 1.0.2: sounds and
projects that used it load as the DRUM engine's kit, on the same key map. FM6's patch bank (the B
slots) was removed in 1.0.3: user presets keep their own FM6 patch, and presets that used a B slot get
that patch on the first start of 1.0.3. SLICE gained a second built-in sound in 1.0.4, PIANO (the SAMPLE
engine's middle C as it was then), next to BREAK. Since 1.0.4 a missing sample (an empty user slot, or a set missing
from the build) plays a plain sine at the note's pitch on SAMPLE, GRAIN and SLICE, and the screen says
NO SAMPLE once. DRUM's KIT variants HAND, CYM and H+CYM were retired in 1.0.5: sounds and projects that
used them play the 66, 10 and 77 kits. SAMPLE's PIANO became a lo-fi piano in 1.4 (PIANO HD above).

**SLICER** (FX page, every track): a tempo-synced 16-step gate or stutter, with 16 patterns.

**Reverb** (FX > REVERB, TYPE): **HALL** (since 1.4, the default on a fresh start: eight delay lines feeding each
other with slowly drifting taps, stereo, SIZE the decay up to about 4.5 s, DAMP how fast the highs die), **ROOM** (the
default up to 1.1.5) and **SPRING**. A project plays the TYPE it was saved with.

## Scale keyboard

On the **SCL** page, set **QNT** to WHITE to play the selected scale using only the
white keys (SNAP keeps every key and rounds it down to the scale). C4 plays **ROOT**; consecutive white keys play consecutive scale notes
above and below it. Black keys are silent, including during live recording and
step entry. **TRN** transposes the resulting notes; the octave buttons shift them
by full octaves. Set QNT to OFF for the normal chromatic keyboard. QNT SEQ snaps the keys like SNAP and
also maps the sequenced notes onto the current ROOT / SCALE as they play (the steps are not changed; drum
kits are never quantized).

Available scales: chromatic (CHR), major (MAJ), natural minor (MIN), Dorian (DOR),
Mixolydian (MIX), major pentatonic (PEN), minor pentatonic (MPEN), harmonic minor
(HARM), Phrygian (PHRY), Lydian (LYD), Locrian (LOC), ascending melodic minor (MEL),
minor blues (BLUES), whole tone (WHOLE), half-whole diminished (DIMHW), and
whole-half diminished (DIMWH). Scales with other than seven notes continue across
the white keys without repeating notes; their roots need not fall on every C key.
Drum kits and incoming MIDI keep their own note mapping.

Press **SCL** again for the **CHORD** page: CHRD picks the chord keys (OFF, the scale's triads or
sevenths, or a fixed shape) and VOIC the voicing.

## If the FM-1 does not start

If an update is interrupted and the FM-1 stays black, check whether a computer sees it as a USB device named
**WL80UBOOT** (or a USB mass-storage device with ID 4C4A:8057). That is the chip's built-in boot mode, and
the FM-1 can be brought back:

- First try another USB data cable, and close every other app that uses MIDI, then run the web installer again.
- If it stays in boot mode, [FM-1 Transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter) reads and
  writes the FM-1's flash from a Mac through a Seeed XIAO RP2040 (three wires to the FM-1's USB lines). Back up
  the flash first, then write the official firmware (M-VAVE's FM-1.fwsc).
